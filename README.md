# Personal Site

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/lucs1590/personal_site/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/lucs1590/personal_site)

This project aims to build my [personal website](https://lucasbrito.now.sh/). Besides, this is where I apply my learnings, in order to structure myself more about architectures, i18n concepts, a11y, frontend techniques and among other things. This project is structured on top of Angular and I always try to keep up to date with updates.

Feel free to use it as a template or to contribute. ðŸ˜Š
