Welcome to my [personal website](https://lucasbrito.com.br/) repository! This project is not only about showcasing my work but also serves as a learning platform where I explore different architectures, i18n concepts, accessibility (a11y), frontend techniques, and more. The site is built on Angular and is constantly updated to keep up with the latest advancements.
