Welcome to my [personal website](https://lucasbrito.com.br/) repository! This project is not only about showcasing my work but also serves as a learning platform where I explore different architectures, i18n concepts, accessibility (a11y), frontend techniques, and more. The site is built on Angular and is constantly updated to keep up with the latest advancements.

Feel free to use this repository as a template or contribute to it. ðŸ˜Š
